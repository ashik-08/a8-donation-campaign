# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Name
- **Donation Campaign**

## Live Website
- [Donation Campaign Website](https://a8-donation-campaign.surge.sh/)

## Description
The Donation Campaign website is a multi-page application built with React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Recharts. Donation data is fetched from a JSON file using an API. Users can tap on donation cards to navigate to detailed donation routes, where they can find a donate button with a fixed amount. Upon donation, the contribution is saved in the local storage and can be accessed on the donation route. Users can view a pie chart on the statistics page, illustrating their donation compared to the total donation. The site is designed to be responsive across various devices.
